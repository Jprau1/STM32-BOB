# STM32-BOB
This breakout-board project was created in my free time. 
- The uC used is an STM32F070CBT6
- The BOB has a dedicated I2C, USART, and SPI port
- Power can be delivered through the Micro USB port or through the screw terminals
- Programs may be flashed through either the Micro USB port or Serial Wire Debug
